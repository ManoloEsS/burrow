# Burrow Configuration File
# Location: ~/.config/burrow/config.yaml
# 
# This file shows all available configuration options for Burrow.
# All values have sensible defaults, so you only need to specify
# what you want to override.

  default_port: "8080"
  # default port to send http requests with empty url input

# Database Settings  
database:
  path: ""

  # Leave empty to use XDG default: ~/.local/share/burrow/burrow.db

  # Database migrations are now embedded in the binary.
  # For development, you can still use GOOSE_MIGRATIONS_DIR env var (deprecated).

# Note: The database connection string is automatically generated
# from the path. You don't need to configure it manually.
